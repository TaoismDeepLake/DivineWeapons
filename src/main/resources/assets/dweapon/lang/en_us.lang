item.power_triangle.manual_page_1=Hold RMB to switch between Attack, Defense and Speed Mode. Pearls reduce mode cooldown and attack mode damage.
item.power_triangle.manual_page_2=I once met a little triangle, or a little boy called Tico. In his world, geometric creatures are common.
item.power_triangle.manual_page_3=He had an interesting ability, which allowed him to transmute his health to mana, mana to his aura, aura to health. He can not recover health and mana directly but can do so with aura. 
item.power_triangle.manual_page_4=Therefore, when he is hurt, he transmutes his aura to health, and he is good as new. With a few transmutations, he will be at full status. In other words, status regenerates in turn.
item.power_triangle.manual_page_5=So I will create a pendant to transmute experience, hunger, and health likewise? No. 
item.power_triangle.manual_page_6=I made something more straight forward: a pendant that can boost attack, defense and speed at choice, but only works in hand. I need a rest after making such complicated whatnot. 
item.power_triangle.manual_page_7=When it functions as a sword, it costs durability on hit. When it works as a field-generator, it evaporates to provide the energy needed. Turn it to attack mode to prevent this waste, or just don't hold it.
item.power_triangle.manual_page_8=I wished it can boost all three aspects, but such a container won't hold such strong divine power. I broke many prototypes to learn that. All I can do is to carry three and rapidly switch them between hands.
item.power_triangle.manual_page_9=Then the idea hit me - what if I carry three of this at the same time? I tried a few methods and finally succeeded after many tries. It no longer needs to be held to function, and the divine power eliminated the evaporation.
item.power_triangle.manual_page_10=Oh, it does regenerate health in defense mode. You don't feel any regeneration buff because the regen buff in this world simply won't work on this mechanic, so I make it regen in another way.

item.gold_sword.manual_page_3=It did not turn well at all. When he tried to drink, wine froze in the cup as gold. Food, no better. He even turned his daughter to gold.
item.gold_sword.manual_page_4=This is just an absurd story claiming greed is not good. However, if you can get gold when you want and control this power, why not?
item.gold_sword.manual_page_5=At first, you get nuggets, then ingots, block. So much of gold that you can build a castle with them. Just keep in mind your inventory is limited, and they are heavy.
item.gold_sword.manual_page_6=I thought this will be fine until I saw a fool cutting his wife for the nuggets. Of course, given enough patience, the gold will be more than enough for medicine or magic to heal the wounds.
item.gold_sword.manual_page_7=However the fool's greed grew and patience dwindled. Therefore I visited him, asked if he wanted the gold to come faster. Of course, he agreed. I took my prototype and enhanced its power.
item.gold_sword.manual_page_8=He grabbed the sword as soon as I finished - and swung it at me. It landed. Meanwhile, a giant block of gold dropped out of nowhere and crushed his head. Pure gold contaminated by his foulness.
item.gold_sword.manual_page_9=I took my work back and laughed painfully. Charm protected me from physical damage, but it killed me to learn not to give my power and trust away to random poor, even they cried for help.  And I will try form other than the sword.

item.disarm_ring.manual_page_3=  I made a similar weapon. The prototype can disarm the target on hit. Right-clicking can do it, too. To be exact, disarming means make the target drop item in the main hand. Hold RMB can deflect arrows.
